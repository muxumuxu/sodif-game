How to edit text

Games are HTML based so all content is stored and could be accessed though the .html files.

Open your main package and go to the Game folder.
There open index.html  file with your HTML editor.
You can use the search tool CTRL+F to find any text you need.
Edit text in HTML editor. Save the file and open it with your Browser to see the changes.
The other way is to use the browser developer tool to find the blocks you want to edit. You can learn more about the developer tools checking the tools description and tutorials on internet.

How to edit images

Open the template folder, go to 'Game/img' directory. You can upload your images with the same name and extension to replace the default ones.

The other way is to upload custom images with your titles and extensions. Then you’ll need to change the image file names in the html files.

Open .html file from the “Game” folder with your html editor.
Use search tool CTRL+F to find the images in the html file.
Replace the image title and extension.
You can replace any images with your's but please don't change the image size.
Uploading Game
In order to make your game "live", you need to upload all the content of "Game" folder from your local computer to your hosting server.

Please note: your website root depends on the directory structure on your hosting server. If you upload the "Game" folder itself into your server, the root to your website will be http://your_domain_name/Game. To avoid this and make the website root http://your_domain_name/ please open the "Game" folder and upload the folder content.

Upload Game to your host using free FTP software FileZilla.

Upload Game to your host using hosting cPanel (WebHost Manager, WHM).

Please do not upload the sources directory or any of the game source files to the hosting server.
